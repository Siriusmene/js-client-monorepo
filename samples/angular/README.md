# Angular Sample

This sample demonstrates how to integrate Statsig with an Angular application. It includes example usage of feature gates, dynamic configs, and experiments.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Review the code in the `src/` folder for integration patterns.
3. Update your Statsig client key in the config files.
4. Run the sample: `npm start` or the appropriate Angular CLI command.

## Notes

- Make sure to use your own Statsig client key.
- See the main [samples README](../README.md) for more context.
