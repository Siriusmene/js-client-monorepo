# Edge Sample

This sample demonstrates using Statsig in an Edge runtime environment.

## How to Use

- See `basic-use.ts` for a simple example of initializing the Statsig client and checking feature gates.
- Update the client key in the example before running.

## Notes

- Edge environments may have different constraints than standard Node.js or browser environments.
- Refer to the main [samples README](../README.md) for more details.
